Cabaret Cariño
Cabaret Cariño is inspired by great rhythm games like the Guitar Hero and the Rock Band series, with our own erotic twist. Our goal with Cabaret Cari ño is to have many different girls and clubs to perform on, as well as ways to customize characters and add some backroom fun so you can enjoy our girls to their full extent.

Why Patreon?
This is a passion project of ours that we’ve been wanting to put together for a long time. We hope that with Patreon we can get enough support to take it to the finish line, as we’re currently working on it part-time while we feed ourselves through our day jobs. If you decide to help us and support us on Patreon, you’ll see frequent game releases based on our vision and feedback from the community. We have experience in illustration, 3D modelling and game development, especially when it comes to art and animation, and we hope this will be a wonderful journey, with great results.

About Us
We are a group of friends that have been looking for a while for good adult games with fun gameplay to enjoy. Noticing how rare these were we decided to create our own game, based on one of our favorite genres!
